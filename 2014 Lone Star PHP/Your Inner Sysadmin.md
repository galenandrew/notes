## Overview
One thing that most programmers do not take the time to understand is the servers that their application lives on. Most know a smattering of Apache configs, PHP configs, and basic information about the OS. This talk will deal with looking at tools that can help you quickly set up a server and how it can help you be a better developer. We'll look at tools like puppet for server management, OSSEC for log management, different command line tools, and nagios/monit for system monitoring.
