## Overview
You've been programming for a while now. You know your way around the code, and you're starting to feel kind of senior. And it looks like someone else noticed, because you're the technical lead on your next project. Congratulations! But now what? It's a big job: The technical lead can be responsible for designing software architecture, writing requirements, interfacing with clients or management, or dividing work amongst the team-- and those are just the parts of the job they tell you about ahead of time. We'll talk about how to oversee the technological vision for the project without losing sight of what's happening on the ground, how to motivate your team members without overstepping your bounds, and some tactics to deal with challenges you might not anticipate, but will almost certainly encounter.

## Tech leading looks different everywhere you go

## Achieve tech lead zen in 3 steps
1. Facilitate
2. Advocate
3. Motivate

### Facilitate
>> Move things forward

Always be asking yourself â€“ What's Next?
1. Remove Roadbloacks - Make sure everyone is able to continue working / move forward
2. Perceive the need - get out in front of the problem

**Tactic #1 - tickets, hours, & burndowns**
Burndowns help understand where you are in the project

**Know the answers or where to find them**
>> As a tech lead you will always be interrupted, so know the answer or where to find it!

>> It's fine to admit not knowing something, but never as an excuse. "I don't know," should burst joyfully from your lips, followed by "but I will find out!"

- Use moments of "not knowing" as opportunities to learn and grow

### Advocate
>> You need to have the 10k ft view in your head, so you can make good decisions about what to do on the ground.

**Tactic #2 - write down everything!**

>> Groundhog day meeting syndrome!

When advocating, you are "fighting for the person/party that is not in the room".

Advocating differs based on who you're talking to:
- Developers
- Managers
- Clients

>> Say **NO** to feature/scope creep, because that's advocating for the project!

### Motivate
- Tech Leading is a form of management...the good kind.

**Keys to motivation**
- Attitude - You decide how this ship is going to sail. You set the tone for the project

You can blow off steam or solve the problem...not both.

### Paradox of Tech Lead
>> You're not writing the code...but you shoulder the responsibility for it.

**ABC's**
Always Be Comparing (...to the requirements)

**Tactic #3**
- Passive-aggressive Whiteboarding


**Minimize Risk**
- Go after the parts that scare you the most
- Relentlessly chase down answers until you aren't scared


>> It can be hard to code when you're a tech lead.
Coders work on the maker's schedule
But TL's are on the manager's schedule
