## About Caleb
- degree in design
- wrote book @ automated unit testing

## SCRUM
- Development
- Engineering
- Process
- Rugby term (everyone huddles together to move the ball down the field)

## What is AGILE?
- Term was coined in 2001
- Methodologies predate
- "Cousin" is LEAN (kanban)

"Software is a cake; SCRUM is a recipe"

"We can not DO AGILE, we can BE AGILE"


## About Scrum
- Scrum is a framework not a methodology

**three roles**
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Self-organizing teams

**three ceremonies**
- spring/iteration
- daily scrum/huddles
- sprint review meeting
release planning
backlog cleaning/grooming

**three artifacts**
- product backlog
- sprint backlog
- burn down chart

### Roles
**Scrum Master**
- Facilitates and protects process
- removes team impediments
**Product Owners**
- Represents the business interests
- sets priorities
- owns the product backlog
**Team**
- Everything else
- self organizes
- owns sprint backlog
- dev, test, arch, DBA, BA, SME, etc

"We have team goals, we are not all the same"

## Scaling Scrum
- Ideal scrum size is 5-9 (7)
- Add more scrum teams

### Scrum of Scrums
SoS is a reactive way to synchronize teams and remove cross team impediments
- multiple teams
- members

### Coordination Team
multiple product owners to align their backlogs
- Organization Backlog

## Product Owner Team
scales the role of Product Owner to support multiple Scrum teams with a single vision
In a POT, the PO acts as a coordinator or QB b/w all of the players. This team supports the scrum team

- Meta Backlog
- Outputs stories to scrum team's backlog
- scrum team

## Pitfalls
- recognize what it means to function as scrum instead of labeling it and still functioning in waterfall
- capacity vs throughput
- productivity vs efficiency
