"Information is cheap, understanding is expensive" - Karl Fast

## Exercise
1. List some things you (or your customers/clients) find confusing
- Stock market (ETFs/Mutual Funds/stocks/options/calls/etc)
- Buying a home…

## Information
**3 aspects of information**
1. Abundance of Info
2. Limited ways to respond (biologically)
3. CRUD* Tools

### Abundance of information
- APIs
- QuantifiedSelf (insights)

### Limited ways to respond
- Freeze
- Trust your gut
- Trust others (wisdom of crowd)
- Trust authorities
- Multitask
- Develop better filters
- Learn to cope
- Unplug
- Making sense of it all (takes time)

**Why?**
For what purpose are we collecting

"As humans, we collect and consume information in order to…"
understand, rationalize, relate, connect, and grow

### CRUD* Tools
Are we doing a good job of understanding information?

Design Patters (Tables, Grids, Lists, etc)
^ they don't contain relationships

## Understanding
**3 things**
1. Visual-Perceptual Processing
2. Interactions
3. Pattern Recognition

## Visual-Perceptual Processing

Pre-attentive processing
^ "How many e's are in this phrase" (then show w/ colored e's)

Forms
- size, shape, positioning, motion, color/hue, orientation, line length, 

### Interactions
- Conversing (verbal)
- Manipulating (externalizing)
- Navigating

Thinking and doing.
Thinking *through* doing.

*** Inventing on principle *** (talk/lecture, art + code, real time feedback)

serendipity in discovery

"Interaction is necessary for personalized understanding"
"Interactive discourages biased viewpoints"

### Pattern Recognition
- letter "a"
- Lovers vs Dolphins

## Continuum

- Perceived Affordances
- Semiotics / Iconography
- Conceptual Metaphors
- Naratives & Stories
