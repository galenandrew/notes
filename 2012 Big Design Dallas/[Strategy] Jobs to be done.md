## BIG D vs little d
(D)ESIGN - design as a process
(d)esign - design as an outcome (making it look pretty)

## Competitive Advantage
60s/70s: Making things cheaper (cheap b/w tv's)
80s/90s: Making things better (bigger/bulkier)
  2000s: Making better things (HD, energy efficient)
 2000s+: Making Meaningful Experiences

"When technology delivers basic needs, user experience dominates" - Donald Norman

## Hierarchy of needs
Maslov's 

Focused on Experiences (people activities, context)
vs
Focused on Tasks (products & features)

6 Flags vs Disney World

## Meaningull Products/Experiences
People don't buy monster trucks because they fit into demo attributes

**Attributes vs Circumstances**

## The UX Stack
1. Purpose
What goal are we trying to achieve?
2. Audience
Who do we need to achieve the goal?
3. Content
What features does(nt) the audience need?
4. Design
What is the best way to present the content?
5. Technology
How is the message presented?

### Audience - Who


## Jobs to be done
- Why do users hire my product?
- Milkshakes -> breakfast replacement

## The equation of progress
F1 + F2 > F3 + F4

**Making Forces**
F1 - Push of the situation
F2 - Pull of the new solution

**Hindering Forces**
F3 - Alliegiance to past behavior
F4 - Anxiety of new situation


"Rather than asking customers what they want, listen to the stories they tell"

"People buy on emotion, and justify on fact"

Companies need to regularly ask themselves, "Are we in the steam locomotive business, or the transportation business?"
